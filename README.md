# PDF Certificate Maker
## Create Bulk PDF Certificates in the Browser

Small React app used to automatically produce a bundle of PDF certificates
from a list of names. Think Adobe Indesign's Data Merge feature.

To be used for mass-producing certificates of achievement and other such
things.

## Development Process
This section covers  developing the React app, webpack usage,
and some other useful details.

### Directory Structure
The key takeaway is that we add React components to `src/components`, 
and let everything else happen automatically. Then when we want to deploy
to the actual server, we can just serve the contents of the 
`dist` folder, which will be an `index.html`, a bundle file, and any images 
the application uses.

```
- root
  - dist <- Everything in here is auto-generated by webpack
    * app.bundle.js
    * index.html
    * any image files, etc.
  - src  <- This is where we do our work
    - components <- React components go here
    * index.html
    * index.js
```

### Pre-requisites:
- Install the required node packages: `npm install`
- Compile everything with webpack: `npm run build`
- Serve things locally in the browser: `npm run start`

### Developing components
- Add React components to the **/src/components** directory. 
- Add subdirectories in the components dir as needed to organize components

### Using Tailwind CSS for styling
Read over the tailwind docs here: [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first)

Add tailwind classes to your react components like so:
```html
<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">Hello world</h1>
```

If you want to define a custom CSS class you can do so in `src/style.css`
